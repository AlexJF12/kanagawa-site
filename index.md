## Who would benefit from this data and report?

If you are interested in running for office, knowing the history and layout of the district you're interested in is a good place to start. This provides that.

And if you are running for a local office, you probably don't have the resources to hire a data person, much less a team. You can use the information provided in this report to help target your GOTV, persuasion, and fundraising efforts.

## What files are included in the report?

* The Voter File, as provided by the State of Florida
* Predictions, per individual, on their likelihood to vote and their likelihood to be a Democrat
* Individuals who have donated to a Federal campaign/PAC
* An interactive map of the 2020 Election results at the precinct level
* An aggregated report showing various counts/sums of voters and donors in different regions

## What is in the Voter File?

The voter file provides information on each registered voter in the state of Florida. It includes their name, address, party registration, and voting history. I have supplemented the donor file with a voter_likelihood and democrat_likelihood, predicting their propensity to vote in the upcoming election and to be a democrat.

## What types of districts are available?

County, School Commissioner, State House, State Senate, US House, and US Senate. If there are other districts you are curious about, feel free to inquire.

## Why only Florida?

I have previous political work experience in Florida, so I figured I'd start there.

## Do you have this report for districts in other states?

Not at this moment, but feel free to reach out and I can see what's possible.

## Can I see a sample report?

Yep! Fill out this form and I can send a sample.

## What does this cost?

The price depends on the size of the district you are interested in. That being said, I can work with your budget. This project is still in draft form and I want to hear feedback.

## Why is this called Kanagawa?

[The Great Wave off Kanagawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Wave_off_Kanagawa) is a famous woodblock print by Japanese artist Hokusai. Woodblock printing requires meticulous work to shape the face of the wood into a piece of art, but can then be used to print its image over and over. In a similar vein, the program to generate this report requires meticulous coding work, but can be used repeatedly to create the finished product.

It also is the inspiration for my favorite emoji. ðŸŒŠ
